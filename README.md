# Healthcare System

In an era where efficient healthcare delivery is essential, particularly in urban centers, the need for a digital solution to manage patient records and appointments is undeniable. The Smart Healthcare System developed by our project team aims to streamline these processes, providing a robust platform for urban hospitals in Sri Lanka to enhance patient care and operational efficiency. By drawing inspiration from global digital health initiatives, our system supports the broader goal of improving healthcare accessibility and quality across the country.
